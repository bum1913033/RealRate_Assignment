Q. Provide the Time and Space complexity of the previous function you wrote:

The time complexity of the function should be: O(n^d) 
where n is the number of elements in the input list paths, and d is the maximum depth of the hierarchy.

The function iterates over each element in the input list once, and for each element, it iterates over the
levels of the hierarchy until it reaches the maximum depth.

The resulting output dictionary also has a size proportional to the number of levels and unique elements
in the hierarchy. Hence, it is also O(n^d).

In this program, the maximum depth of the hierarchy that we can access is, for instance, "bs.ass.fixAss.gain1".
This means that the maximum depth is 4, hence d = 4.

Therefore, the time and space complexity should be O(n^4).
